Oh, dear reader, did you just read that book?
A tale of options, and a market that's shook?
It's filled with rhymes and words that are trite,
Like a stale, flat soda, it offers no bite.

The author, they tell, but they never show,
The jungle of options, where fortunes do grow.
With boring explanations, and metaphors so bland,
They fail to ignite, a spark in the land.

"Gamma, a beast, with a double-edged sword!"
This tired old trope, should have been ignored.
Instead of "Positive Gamma," a friend to the bold,
Show us a trader, with a story untold.

Let's hear a conversation, between a young newbie,
And a seasoned pro, whispering words so sleazy.
"You see, young one, Gamma's a force so sly,
It can make your profits soar, or watch them all die!"

"Covered calls, cash-secured puts, a toolbox so grand,"
The author just lists, with a lifeless hand.
We need to see a trader, sweating and stressed,
As they navigate options, and put their skills to the test.

Instead of "The Options Jungle is a place of skill and art,"
Show us a trader's mind, with a beating heart.
Give us a scene, a tense negotiation,
Where Gamma's power, creates a wild sensation.

This book is a lecture, a dull, boring drone,
It's time for the author, to pick up a phone.
Call a real trader, and ask them to share,
A story of risk, a triumph, or a despair.

Instead of bland descriptions, and metaphors so worn,
Let the market's drama, be vividly born.
Show us the struggle, the fear, and the thrill,
Of taming the Gamma, with masterful skill.

Remember, dear author, the reader wants to see,
The action, the drama, the story's decree.
Don't just tell us, how Gamma does play,
Make us feel the tension, each and every day.

So, throw out the rhymes, and the metaphors weak,
Let the market's voice, be powerful and sleek.
With a story to tell, and a human touch,
Your book on Gamma, will be a powerful clutch.
